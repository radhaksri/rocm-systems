/// @brief Diagnostics for guest register accesses against an emulated device.
///
/// @details Two failure modes dominate when an unmodified kernel driver is
/// brought up against an emulated device, and neither is visible from the guest
/// side.
///
/// The first is a register the device does not model. The driver reads it, gets
/// a default value, and either misbehaves later or gives up. Every such access
/// is counted here so that one boot produces a ranked list of what to implement
/// next, rather than a single error at a time.
///
/// The second is a driver spinning on a status bit that the device will never
/// set. The guest simply stops making progress; because the driver is polling
/// rather than faulting, nothing is logged on either side and the boot appears
/// to hang. Repeated reads of one register with no intervening write are the
/// signature of that state, so they raise a warning that names the register.
///
/// A @ref rocjitsu::BarAccessTrace is fed from the device's BAR access
/// dispatcher and is safe to feed from the transport thread while another
/// thread reads a report.
