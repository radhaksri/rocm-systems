/// @brief Live-in analysis for a probe body.
///
/// This unit answers the complement of `probe_clobber.h`: what does the probe
/// body read before defining it? That set is the probe's input register
/// footprint.
///
/// Which of those inputs the framework supplies depends on the ABI in force, so
/// the analysis subtracts `supplied_registers()` and never enumerates the
/// conventions itself. That subtraction is the return-link pair, which every
/// convention supplies by construction, plus the argument VGPRs the ABI's
/// declared count covers.
///
/// Nothing in a body distinguishes "reads v0 as its first argument" from "reads
/// v0 uninitialized", so the argument count is declared by the caller and
/// checked here: a declared argument the body reads subtracts away, and one it
/// reads but the caller did not declare stays in the result and fails the site.
/// This needs no argument-specific code -- the widened supplied set does it.
///
/// Scope: ordinary registers — SGPR, VGPR, AccVGPR — read before being defined.
/// That is the shape of a value the kernel prologue supplies and an arbitrary
/// instrumentation site does not, which is the dependence this analysis exists
/// to find.
///
/// Special state (EXEC, VCC, SCC, M0, FLAT_SCRATCH) is the trampoline's to
/// handle, not this analysis's: `RegisterSet` cannot represent it
/// (`isa/register_set.h`) and `LivenessAnalysis` does not model it. A probe
/// reading special state it never wrote is therefore accepted here — including
/// SCC, which the call envelope's address arithmetic clobbers outright, and M0,
/// which CDNA `ds_*` reads implicitly. Neither is a gap in this gate.
///
/// The one thing this scope does oblige is that the encoded operands name every
/// ordinary register the body reads. Relative and GPR-indexed forms break that
/// by displacing an index at runtime, so they are rejected rather than analyzed:
/// the VGPR forms via `LivenessAnalysis::global_vgpr_usage_is_complete()`, the
/// scalar `s_movrel*` family via a local scan, since liveness models no scalar
/// equivalent.

/// for @p arch, a decode failure, a probe entry that does not start a decoded
/// block, or a body whose relative / GPR-indexed VGPR access or relative SGPR
