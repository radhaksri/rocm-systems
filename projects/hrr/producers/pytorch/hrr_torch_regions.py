# HRR region producer for PyTorch's HIP caching allocator.
#
# PyTorch calls hipMalloc once per segment and then carves per-tensor blocks out
# of it with host pointer arithmetic, so HRR records the segment and never sees
# the blocks. This writes the block layout down beside the capture, which is what
# lets replay tell "this pointer addresses a live tensor" from "this pointer is
# past the end of one".
#
# Usage: put this directory on PYTHONPATH via a sitecustomize.py, or import it
# from the application:
#
#     import hrr_torch_regions; hrr_torch_regions.start()
#
# It is inert unless HRR capture is active, so leaving it enabled costs one idle
# thread. The format it writes is specified in ../README.md; it calls no HRR
# function and links against nothing.
