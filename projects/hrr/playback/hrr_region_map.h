/*
 * hrr_region_map.h — replay-side consumer of external region annotations.
 *
 * Loads every .hrrr sidecar in an archive's regions/ directory (format in
 * hrr_regions.h), merges them into one timestamp-ordered stream, and replays
 * that stream in lockstep with the captured events so that at any point during
 * playback the map holds the set of regions that were live at the corresponding
 * instant of the original run.
 *
 * Two things come out of that:
 *
 *   - Bounds. A kernel-argument pointer that lands inside a captured segment
 *     but inside no live block is an intra-segment out-of-bounds or stale
 *     pointer. Replay cannot see this on its own, because the segment is one
 *     contiguous allocation and the block layout inside it never crossed a HIP
 *     API. classify() reports it.
 *   - Reachability. A segment the producer declared but that HRR never observed
 *     (HIP bypassed: direct HSA allocation, a foreign VMM pool, imported
 *     memory) is materialised, so pointers into it translate instead of
 *     reaching a kernel as null.
 *
 * Ordering assumes a totally ordered replay stream, so the map is used only in
 * single-threaded replay (the default). It is inert under --multi-thread.
